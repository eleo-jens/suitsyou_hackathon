    <!-- ONLY FOR EXTERNAL SCRIPTS: the defer attribute tells the browser to continue downloading the HTML content once the script tag has been reached -->
    <!-- 
      async and defer both instruct the browser to download the script(s) 
      in a separate thread, while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) 
      is downloading, so the page loading is not blocked during the fetch process.
      
      scripts with a defer attribute will load in the order they are in and will only 
      execute once everything has finished loading.

      If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, 
      then use async.
